# Contributing to Java-Fluent

Thank you for taking your time to read this document!

## Found a bug?

Please **check the [reported issues](https://github.com/peterjeschke/fluent/issues)** to make sure that the issue wasn't reported before. If you can provide additional info to an already existing bug, please do so! But don't open a new issue, please.

If your bug hasn't been reported, head over to the [issues](https://github.com/peterjeschke/java-fluent/issues/new) and create a new issue. Please make sure you **use the correct template**, and fill out all fields so we can help you. Also **include a clear title and description**.

## Want to suggest an enhancement?

*}Please do so!** We have an issue-template for that. But as usual, please make sure that this enhancement wasn't suggested before and use clear language.

## Have a question?

You can create an issue for that, too.

## Want to contribute code?

Nice! Create a new PR with your changes. Your commits should follow [commit message guidelines](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide). Also include the issue number in your commit message if the commit fixes an existing issue. The description of your PR should describe **what** your change does and **why** it does it. The *how* is not important, we can see this in your code ;).

Every PR will run some status checks, whether the code works, is properly formatted, etc ... Your PR has to pass all checks to get accepted!

### Formatting

Included in the project is an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) and an IntelliJ IDEA formatter. Please follow these guidelines and make sure your code is properly formatted.

### Testing

If you fix a bug or contribute new code, please add unit-tests so we know your code actually works ;).
